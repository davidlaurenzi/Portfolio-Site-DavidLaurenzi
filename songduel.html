          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>SONGDUEL was born as the result of a casual game I play with friends when they come over. We pull up Spotify and then take turns picking the next song. Ideally, the songs flow well into one another and aren’t just random. What you might
            think you want to play will change based on what the person before you plays. The playlists that get made can be saved by all of the players involved, and it’s an opportunity for people to share music that someone might otherwise not have
            heard. SONGDUEL connects to Spotify, and players can be found through friend lists, or matched through the app by people having similar music libraries. When playing online, users simultaneously stream the same music. The goal is to
            figure out what song to play next before your opponent’s song is finished.</p>

          <h2>Process</h2>
          <div>
            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>I started the process of developing SONGDUEL by defining the potential competition and figuring out what was necessary to set the app apart from others in the space. There are countless music streaming apps however just a few that are
              social sharing apps. Two of the main social music apps are RIFF and SOUNDSHARE. These apps focus mainly on a chat and social network framework and are more cumbersome. They look to have their app as a main ecosystem for music, whereas
              SONGDUEL seeks to focus on a strpped down concept that is more like a game. Think “Words with Friends” but for music. The playlists that are created can then be exported to the users’ Spotify account.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>User Base</h3>
            <p>I then defined the user base for the app. It would appeal to anyone that is a music fan that likes to share their love of music and is interested in broadening their exposure to new music while being social. Because of the ability to
              chat and interact, I determined the game is best focused towards adults over 18.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <p>Finally, I created a list of key features that I would use as an outline to define the app along with driving the eventual user flows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sync with user’s Facebook to connect with friends with whom to play</li>
              <li>Connect with users’ Spotify to gather music preferences and playlists, as well as to export playlists made to their libraries.</li>
              <li>Connect users with other users, based on their music preferences</li>
              <li>Users will be able to chat with connections made on the app</li>
              <li>Allow users to “compete” in creating playlists in real time while simultaneously listening to music</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

          <h2>Wireframe</h2>
          <p>After creating my initial low-fidelity sketches, I translated my screens into mid-fidelity wireframes and added aditional screens that were necessary to complete user stories. Because this was my first time building a native app for both
            iOS and Android platforms, I pulled heavily from Human Interface and Material Design templates. I researched design patterns from other music apps to see what worked and what could be improved upon and implemented my findings. Because
            SONGDUEL was going to be driven by Spotify, I wanted to keep the design patterns similar so the user would find the interface intuitive.</p>

          <h2>Branding</h2>
          <p>SONGDUEL participants are essentially playing DJs, dueling against one another firing songs back and forth, hence the name of the app. I based the logo on the S letterform, and the symbol for infinity. The curves are 2 interlocking
            circles representing a 33rpm record. The logo conveys rhythm, and abstractly forms an image of 2 DJs spinning from above.</p>
          <p>The color pallet is mainly dark like the lighting at a live music venue or nightclub with vivid accent colors that glow against the darkness evoking stage lighting or the electronics on a DJ mixer or soundboard. The effect will be more
            pronounced when combined with the intended animation during gameplay.</p>
          <p>The icons and typography are pulled from Apple’s Human Interface, and Google’s Material Design guidelines, hence SF Pro and Roboto.</p>

          <h2>Design & User Testing</h2>
          <div>
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>Once I defined the overall feeling for the app, I applied it to my wireframes. I found the most difficult part of the project to be actually sourcing template files and gaining an understanding of the requirements of Material Design.
              The resources are much more limited than Apple’s Human Interface. Although Google has extensive outlines defining a look, template files are hard to find. As someone that hasn’t used Android before this was frustrating. I ended up
              realizing that because there are multiple manufacturers for Android, and the OS is more open than Apple’s, there is also more room for variables. In the end, I translated my initial iOS design into a more hard edged style and utilized
              the templates that I was able to find and I believe it was successful.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <p>When I completed the high-fidelity screens, I created a simple prototype of each version using Sketch’s built in prototyping feature. I then had users navigate their way through and asked them to give me any feedback they may have on
              usability or design. This proved a little challenging because the game nature of the app is dependent on feedback from an opponent and I was unable to replicate that variable. Because of this limitation, I conducted the user testing
              over video chat so I was able to guide my test participants on areas where they may need to wait for an opponent’s interaction. I tested 5 people and to my surprise they all found the interface very intuitive and had no issues with
              navigating the app. The only main issue was pointed out by someone who happens to be a DJ and he had issue with the word “play”. He suggested that it only be used when referring directly to playing a song, as opposed to a player taking
              their turn or playing the game. I agreed and made the changes across the screens.</p>
            <p>You can see the prototypes here:</p>

            </ul>
          </div>

        <div class="container">
          <h2>Takeaway</h2>
          <p>Overall, I believe the project was a success, but I could see this app evolving into multi-player mode where you can play against more than one opponent. I also think having the game link to Apple Music or other music platforms could be
            beneficial.</p>
          <p>My main takeaway however would be for SONGDUEL to evolve into a dating app. With the music matching algorithm involved in SONGDUEL, this could connect people that are musically compatible. It would also give matches an activity to share,
            which would help break the ice and solve the problem of starting a conversation that so many people have.</p>
